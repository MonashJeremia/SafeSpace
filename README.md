FIT5032 Assignment, making a website catering "Youth mental health and wellbeing"

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then add your API keys:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Get your API key from [Resend](https://resend.com/api-keys)

**Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to Git. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
